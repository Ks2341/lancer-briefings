Due to the success of mission **DISTANT PYRE**, Squad **DELTA-ECHO-ECHO-ZULU** was seconded by UNION command to EBRO-class UNS-CV RIO GRANDE as Lancer attaché to naval contingent tasked with a diplomatic mission on Cressidium.

Cressidium is a planet that was settled by Union’s Second Committee just before it was overthrown by the coalition that would eventually become the current-day Third Committee. 

As revolution swept throughout Union space, sparked by mounting oppression and atrocities, many SecComm bureaucrats and military commanders fled their homeworlds looking for a safe haven to ride out the storm. 

Among the places they fled—bringing their friends, families, and politically connected allies with them—was Cressidium, a recently charted and newly colonized world that boasted suitable Cradle-like conditions for habitation and an abundance of natural resources. Information on Cressidium’s location and its colonization was purged by those who fled there in an attempt to cover their tracks. This included scuttling the world’s omninet infrastructure to prevent detection, and in the aftermath of the revolution the world was lost from official record.

As of [REDACTED] hours, UNS-CV RIO GRANDE is on combat alert. A transmission from
Ambassador Bannerjee indicates that civil defense warnings were being sounded across Nov Elysia. Then all communications with the surface went dark, and the crew has been unable to raise the ambassador, the captain, or anyone within the local government.
Based on orbital flyover imagery gathered by Rio, it appears that Nov Elysia is under attack by Vestan Sovereignty forces, with significant deployment of mechanized chassis forces throughout the city.
