## The Drop

The mission, as outlined, seems straightforward
enough: mechs and marines from the Rio Grande will
deploy near a staging area location in Nov Elysia’s
industrial district designated **Forward Operating
Base Saber.** 

Once assembled, they’ll resupply if
necessary and then move out toward the central
district where the diplomatic talks were taking place,
heading for the last known location of the captain
and ambassador. 

After the VIPs have been secured,
they’ll be escorted back through a defensive
perimeter established by a second wave of Union
forces to a safe location away from the fighting and
extracted by shuttle back to the Rio Grande.
Squad **DELTA-ECHO-ECHO-ZULU** have been selected as part of the initial
landing, which means they’re headed down to
Cressidium along with the rest of the first wave.

# Goals
- ~~Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders~~
- Make your way through Nov Elysia to reach **FOB Saber**

# Mission Parameters
- Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
- ~~Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's time table back and potentially narrowing the windows of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee~~
- Failure to clear an apporach corridor to **FOB Saber** through Sovereignty defenses will result in additional casualties and delays for second-wave reinforcements arriving from RIO Grande.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
